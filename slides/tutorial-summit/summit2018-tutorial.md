## About the VM

- Compatible with VirtualBox 5.2 or VMWare Player

--

- Download it from [here](http://demo-fit.saclay.inria.fr/vms/RIOT-LORA-VM.ova)
  and import it in VirtualBox/VMWare. Then start it.

--

- The full RIOT course is located in **~/riot-course**

  - **Important:** Call `git pull` from `~/riot-course` and
    `~/riot-course/exercises` to get the latest version of the tutorial and
    exercises

  - A local clone of RIOT 2018.07 is in **~/riot-course/RIOT**

  - Exercices are located in **~/riot-course/exercises**

--

- All required development tools are already installed:

  - The GNU ARM Embedded 7.3 toolchain is installed

  - The IoT-LAB cli-tools are installed

  - A list of common editors: Vim, Emacs, VSCode

## About IoT-LAB

.center[<a href=https://www.iot-lab.info>https://www.iot-lab.info</a><br><br>
IoT-LAB is a large scale experimentation testbed]

  - Can be used for testing wireless communication networks on small devices

  - Can be used for learning IoT programming and communication protocols

  - Can be used for testing software platforms

## IoT-LAB in short

- **2071** programmable nodes, 4 architectures
  <br> &#x21d2; Cortex-M, MSP430, Cortex-A8, AVR

--

- Heterogeneous platforms
  <br> &#x21d2; iotlab-m3, iotlab-a8, Atmel SAMR21-Xpro, Arduino Zero,
  ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1, Zolertia Firefly

--

- Heterogeneous radios &#x21d2; 802.15.4, 802.15.4g, LoRa, BLE (soon)

## Setup your IoT-LAB access in the VM (1)

1. Start the VM and open a command window

2. Grab one paper with the account credentials (user is riotsummit*X*)

3. Register your IoT-LAB credentials
   ```sh
   $ iotlab-auth -u riotsummitX
   ```
4. Start an experiment with one ST node on Saclay site:
   ```sh
   $ iotlab-experiment submit -n summit -d 300 \
                               -l 1,archi=st-lrwan1:sx1276+site=saclay
   Using custom api_url: https://www.iot-lab.info/rest/
   {
      "id": 133XXX
   }
   ```
   The experiment will book one node during 300 minutes on Saclay site

5. Wait for the experiment to be in "Running" state:
  ```sh
  $ iotlab-experiment wait -i 133XXX
  "Running"
  ```
---

## Setup your IoT-LAB access in the VM (2)

- Check the name of the iotlab node associated to the experiment:
  ```sh
  $ iotlab-experiment get -i 133XXX -r
  {
      "items": [
          {
              "archi": "st-lrwan1:sx1276",
              "mobile": "0",
              "mobility_type": " ",
              "network_address": "st-lrwan1-10.saclay.iot-lab.info",
              "site": "saclay",
              "state": "Alive",
              "uid": " ",
              "x": "5",
              "y": "67.3",
              "z": "4"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

&#x21d2; in this case, **st-lrwan1-10.saclay.iot-lab.info** is the node that
was selected by the IoT-LAB booking system.
